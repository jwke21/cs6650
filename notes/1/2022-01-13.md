**Scalability**: "The property of a system to handle a growing amount of work by adding resources to the system."

#### Scaling Software Systems

1) The number of simultaneous requests a system can process
2) The amount of data a system can effectively process and manage
3) The value that can be derived from data through predictive analytics
4) Maintain a stable, consistent response time as the request load grows

Example - Supermarket System Scaling
- Self checkouts to increase volume capacity
- Ability to predict stock based on varying factors

Inability to increases cost and decreases customer satisfaction

Early in system lifetime, new features take precedent over scalability
- Implementing scalability too early can hinder early development and cause development inertia

Often a tipping point is reached where design decisions that made sense under light loads become technical debt
- Often external events cause these external events

**Scaling Up or Scaling Out**: Increasing a systems' capacity

**Scale Down**: Reduce system costs

#### Scalability - Basic Design Principles

**System's Throughput**: The number of requests that a system can process in any given time period

Increasing Capacity via **Replication**: Replicate the software processing resources to provide more capacity
- Adding more servers or improving hardware
- Must be done to remedy real bottlenecks otherwise can incur increased cost without any scalability benefits

Increasing Capacity via **Optimization**: Using resources more efficiently
- Using more efficient algorithms
- Adding indexes to databases to speed up queries
- Rewriting servers in a faster programming language

Scalability is achieved via Replication and Optimization

#### Scalability and Cost

A software system not designed to scale will cost more to transform
- Foundations of scale must be built in at the beginning

Scalability = f( (effort * cost) + (deployment * cost))

**(Hyper) Scalable Systems**: Systems whose costs grow lineraly while capacity grows exponentially
