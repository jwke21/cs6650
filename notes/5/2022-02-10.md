<b>Conversational State</b>
- Implementations requiring scale should avoid storing conversational state
	- Any info that is retained between requests such that the subsequent request can assume the service has retained state about the interactions
- Services storing conversational state are stateful services

<b>Stateless</b>
- Requires client to provide all necessary info for server to process request

Is MBeans an API to info the JVM maintains?

Types of load balances:
1) Network level
2) Application layer

<b>Caching Patterns</b>
- Cache-aside caching: application looks in both cache and database
- Read-through: Application reads from cache, if miss then reads from database
- Write-through: Application writes to cache, cache writes to database
- Write behind: Cache writes to database before waiting for application to finish writing to it

CDNs are Edge Caches

<b>Cache control directives</b>
- **no-store**: Do not store in cache
- **no-cache**: Cached resource must be revalidated before use
- **private**: Resource can only be cached by user-specific device (e.g. Web browser)
- **public**: Can be cached by any proxy server
- **max-age**: TTL (seconds)
- **Expires** and **Last-Modified**: can be used to determine "freshness" of content

<b>Etag</b> is another way to specify cache freshness
- Can be used with **if-none-match** to ensure HTTP 304 is returned even if there is no match for requested resource
