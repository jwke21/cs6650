<b>WAN Routers</b>
- Internet routers transmit data across the physical network connections from source to destination

<b>Wireless Networking - Wifi</b>
- Range is of the order of 10's of meters, affected by physical impediments

<b>Internet Protocol Suite Layers</b>
1) **Data link layer**: specifies communications across a single network segment
2) **Internet (IP) layer**: Specifies addressing and routing protocols for traffic to traverse between networks
3) **Transport (TCP, UDP) layer**: Protocols for reliable and best-effort host-to-host communications
4) **Application layer**: Application level protocols such as HTTP and SCP

<b>Idempotence</b>
- Reads - Requests that make no persistent state changes are idempotent
- Updates - clients send a unique idempotence-key in all requests that mutate state
	- Server checks if it has previously seen the idempotence key value by reading from a database for implementing idempotence
