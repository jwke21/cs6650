#### Why threads? Simple threads in Java

Threads enable concurrency (i.e. parallel execution) which is core to any distributed system

Multiple threads allow us to exploit mutiple cores

Threads share the same address space
- Consumes less memory
	- Spawning is cheaper
	- Context switching is cheaper

Processes are different executables
-  Any process can create multiple processes

Threads are lightweight compared to processes
- Share same address space and share data and code
- Allocated their own stack space to support independent execution

Java threads are handled by creating a class that implements the `Runnable` class and overrides the `void run()` method.
- To run the thread, the class is instantiated and the `start()` method is called
	- Never call the `run()` method directly

Threads are executed non-deterministicly
- The order of execution is not governed by the code, rather it governed by the scheduler of the JVM or OS

The `join()` method causes the current thread to pause execution until other threads are terminated
- More robust method for **thread interleaving** than using the `sleep()` method

Threads and objects are orthogonal concepts
- Objects are basically state machines
	- State transitions invoked when methods called
- Threads define an execution context
	- Manipulate objects (state) they have reference to
	- The methods they call execute in the context of the calling thread
- Objects can be shared by threads

#### Problems with Threading and Synchronization Primitives

Problems with concurrency:
1) Race conditions
2) Deadlocks

Source of problems:
1) Non-determinism
2) Interleavings

**First Problem**: Shared variables
- Multiple independent threads make changes to same variable at same time non-atomically

Race conditions
- Same program, different results
	- Results depend on manner of execution
- Extremely hard to debug
	- Not reproducible
- Root cause: non-determinism

**Synchronization primitives** can be used to avoid race conditions
- **Locks** can be used to impose ordering constraints
	- Protect shared variables to **serialize** access to shared resources
	- Each thread wishing to access a variable:
		1) Takes the lock
		2) Changes the variable
		3) Releases the lock

The `synchronized` keyword on a variable is used to indicated it can be accessed by only one thread at a time
- Known as <em>critical sections</em>
	- It is not possible for two calls of any synchronized method on the same object to interleave

Synchronization is implemented using **monitors**.
- Each object in Java is associated with a monitor, which a thread can <em>lock</em> (i.e. <em>acquire</em>) or <em>unlock</em> (i.e. <em>release</em>)
- Only one thread at a time may hold a lock on a monitor
	- Other threads attempting to lock that monitor are blocked until they can obtain a lock on that monitor
- It is a synchronization primitive placed at class hierarchy root, `java.lang.Object`, and is handled by the JVM
	- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3362303/whats-a-monitor-in-java

**Atomic Variables** are another way to implement synchronization
- e.g. `AtomicInteger` class

**Barrier Synchronization**: blocks execution until all threads reach the same point
- **CountDown Latch** implements a barrier
	- Initialized with a given count
	- `await()` blocks until count is zero
	- `countdown()` method decrements value
	- When count is zero, all threads resume (i.e. `await()` returns)
	- The count cannot be reset
	- A `CyclicBarrier` should be used if you need to reset the count


#### Thread Coordination

**The Dining Philosophers Problem** (a.k.a. **Resource Contention**) was introduced by Dijkstra
- State machine is:
	- Think for a while -> Pick up chopsticks -> Eat for a while -> Put down chopsticks -> Beginning of loop
- Is example of a **Deadlock**

```
While(true) {
	// Initially, thinking about life, universe, and everything
	think();

	// Take a break from thinking, hungry now
	pick_up_left_fork();
	pick_up_right_fork();
	eat();
	put_down_right_fork();
	put_down_left_fork();

	// Not hungry anymore. Back to thinking!
}
```

A deadlock occurs when 2 threads sharing access to 2 shared variables via locks
1) Thread 1 takes lock a
2) Thread 2 takes lock b
3) Thread 1 blocks on b
4) Thread 2 blocks on a
- Violates the **liveness** property of a system (i.e. the property that eventually progress will be made in the system)
- Caused by **resource contention**
- Circular wait

The solution to a deadlock is to impose a total ordering on acquisition of resources

Illustration of why concurrency is hard:
- Too few ordering contraints => race conditions
- Too many ordering constraints => deadlocks
- Testing is difficult due to non-determinisim
- Hard/impossible to reason about based on modularity

#### Thread States

States are managed by the JVM and/or OS

Thread states:
- **New Thread** state (**Created** state)
	- Created but not started - ready to run
	- Put into **Blocked**
- **Runnable** state (and **Running** state)
	- Started and either running or waiting to run
	- Can transition into **Blocked** or **Terminated** 
- **Blocked** state
	- Can be woken up and put back into **Runnable** or **Terminated**
- **Terminated** state
	- `stop()` called or `run()` terminates

The Java scheduler is a priority scheduler
- A thread inherits its priority from its parent
- A thread's prioirty can be changed but its default is 5
- Higher priority threads will be run first
- Same priority threads are chosen with a round-robin policy

**Reentrancy**: If a thread tries to acquire a lock it already holds, it succeeds
- Every Java object has a **intrinsic** lock associated with it (i.e. its monitor or mutex locks)
	- Intrinsic locks are reentrant
- Synchronized methods exploit the intrinsic lock by requiring ownership of the object's monitor before executing the synchronized block and releasing it after termination
- Each lock has an acquisition count and owning thread
	- Count can only be incremented above 1 by same owning thread
	- Lock is released when count reaches 0
- Prevents random deadlocking

#### The Producer Consumer Problem

**The Producer Consumer Problem**: Many producer threads writing to a data buffer, many consumer threads reading from the buffer

Contract requirements:
1) Consumer waits if buffer empty
2) Consumer can remove item when buffer not empty
3) Producer waits if buffer full
4) Producer can add item if buffer has free space

Producer-Consumer instances require **Guards** on put and get operations

Java's `wait()` and `notify()` statements act as guards
- Provide inter-thread communication that synchronizes on the same object

Thread safety requires the internal state of an object to be protected from concurrent updates
- Updates must be atomic and serialized
- Adds a runtime overhead

Stateless and Immutable objects are always thread-safe by nature

#### Thread Pools

The `java.util.concurrent` package contains a range of utilities to simplify multithreaded programs
- e.g. **Executor framework**
- e.g. Thread-safe collections

Thread pools provide a mechanism for an application to control number of threads
- Reuses threads to minimize creation cost
- Fixed memory size for the thread pool

Thread pools support a task-based programming model
- Tasks can be submitted to a thread pool which will use its own policies to handle execution of those threads

**Task Submitters** submit tasks to an **Executor Service** which holds the tasks in the queue. As threads in the **Thread Pool** become available, they will remove a task from the **Task Queue** and execute it.
- New threads are not created everytime a new task is required

Objects implementing the **Executor** interface acts as an **Executor Services**
- Decouples task submission from task executions
	- Supports different task execution

**Executors** provide a factor method to create an **Executor** with desired policies:
- Single threaded, fixed thread pool, cached thread pool (growable)

The **Thread Pool Executor** is an implementation of the **ExecutorService** interface
- There is a **corePoolSize** and a **maxPoolSize**

**Question**: Is the Thread Pool always FIFO, or can there be notions of priority?

There is no way to obtain the result of a Runnable submitted to the Executor
- Need to use ExecutorService to get return values
	- Supplements `submit()` method to enable it to take a `Callable` which will return a value from the callable

Thread pools must be shutdown by calling `executorService.shutdown()`
- Stops accepting new taks until all threads become idle at which point `executorService.awaitTermination()` will return

#### Thead-Safe Collection

None of the classes in `java.util` package are thread-safe
- Except `Vector` and `HashTable` (legacy reasons)
- Because synchronized methods are slow

2 options for thread safety:
1) Provide a custom wrapper that has synchronized methods
2) Use Collections factory method to create thread-safe versions

Synchronized wrappers still incur performance penalty

Java 5.0 includes the concurrent collections package, `java.util.concurrent`
- Rich collection of classes specifically designed for efficient multithreaded access

**ConcurrentHashMap**: `HashMap` divided into buckets (16 by default) each of which has its own lock
- Other buckets can be accessed while others are locked
- Trade-offs - relaxed consistency for:
	- Iterators
	- `Map.size()`
	- `Map.isEmpty()`

**BlockingQueue**: Blocks `Producer.put()` until space, blocks `Consumer.take()` until not empty

**CopyOnWriteArrayList**: Thread-safe variant of `ArrayList`
- Mutators create a snapshot of the underlying array: each thread using an iterator sees is own version of snapshot of the array created while initializing the iterator for this list
	- Any mutations will not reflect during iteration since the iterator was created
- Useful in multithreaded code when reads frequent and updates rare


## Class Notes

Increased response time/latency -> decreased throughput

Forward proxy: modifies outbound packets

Reverse proxy: modifies inbound packets

Distributed systems should be stateless: they should not store any state about the incoming requests

Two main types of distributed databases:
1) Distributed SQL stores
2) Distributed NoSQL stores

Response time = RTT
