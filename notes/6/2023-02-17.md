# Asynchronous Messaging Basics

Clients (i.e. **producers**) send requests to intermediary messaging service (i.e. **message broker**) which acts as a delivery mechanism to relay the message to the intended destination (i.e. **consumer**)

<b>Messaging Primitives</b>
- Message queues store a sequence of messages
- Publishers/Producers send messages to queues
- Consumers retrieve messages from queues
- A message broker manages 1 or more queues

Consumers need to acknowledge recipient of messages
- **Auto Ack**: Messages are acknowledge as soon as they're delievered to consumer and before they're processed
	- Lowest latency message delivery
	- Vulnerable to message loss at consumer if crash occurs
- **Manual Ack**: Messages are ack'd after it is processed at consumer
	- Increases ack latency
	- Robust to crashes at consumer

By default message queues are maintained in memory by the message broker
- To ensure **data safety** the message can be written to disk before the process is complete
	- Messages can be recovered on failure

<b>Publish-Subscribe</b>: A one-to-many messaging architecture
- Message queues are known as **topics**
	- Delivers each published to one or more **subscribers**
- Highly flexible because publishers are decoupled from subscribers
- Places additional burden on broker
- Fundamental to event-based architectures

<b>Message Replication</b>: Message incoming messages are replicated from a primary broker (i.e. **leader**) to other brokers (i.e. **followers**) and outgoing messages are removed from both
- Robust to single point of failures
- **Follower** is known as a hot standby
- **Failover**: producers and consumers can continue to operate by sending messages to followers upon leader failure
	- Implemented in client libraries for the message broker (i.e. is transparant to producers and consumers)

# RabbitMQ Architecture

One of the most widely utilized message brokers in distributed systems

First released in 2009

Open source

<b>Basic Architecture</b>
- Producers send messages to exchanges
	- Messages contain metadata including a **routing key** which determines the queue that the exchange will forward the message to
- Exchanges distribute messages to queues based on exchange semantics
- Consumer retrieve messages from queues

**Message Exchange**
- **Direct**: Delievers a message to a queue based on matching the value of a routing key which is published with each message
- **Topic**: Delivers a message to 1 or more queues based on matching the routing key and a pattern used to bind a queue to the exchange
- **Fanout**: Delivers a message to all queues that are bound to the exchange, and the routing key is ignored

**Bindings** are rules that the message delivery algorithm uses in conjunction with exchange types to determine the relationship between an exchange and a queue

Since creating connections is a large overhead, continuous long-lived connection between clients is a common usage pattern

**Channels** are logical connections between a client and a broker
- Only exist in the context of a **RabbitMQ** connection
- Channels multiplexed over a connection
- Creation involves a round trip to broker
- Channel-per-thread model
- Channels are not thread-safe
	- Every thread requires exclusive access to a channel

**Message Broker Tuning**
- One thread allocated to each queue
- On multicore - one queue per core is optimal
- Best performance when queues are short
	- Arival rate ~= consumption rate
	- Optimizes memory operations
- Broker utilizes 40% of broker memory by default
	- Throttles producers after memory limit reached
	- Can increase performance by allocating more memory

<b>Data Safety</b>: Reliability of message delivery
- Falure scenarios:
	1) Producer sends message to broker and message is not successfully received by broker
	2) Message is in a queue and broker crashes
	3) Message is successfully delivered to consumer but consumer fails before processing message
- Performance vs. safety trade-off
	- If app can tolerate message loss, performance can be prioritized

Data features
1) **Publisher-confirms**: Publisher requires acknowledgement from broker that the message has been successfully received
2) **Persistent messages and message queues**: Broker writes messages to disk
3) **Consumer manual acknowledgements**: Broker requires acknowledgement from client once it finishes processing message

RabbitMQ supports: Mirrored queues (to be deprecated) and quorum queues
- 2 or more brokers are deployed as a cluster
- Each queue has a leader and several followers
- Publishers send to leader, leader replicates to followers
- Consumers connect to leaders
- Quorum queues are persistent and have better failure handling
