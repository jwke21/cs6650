# Architecture Basics

## Scaling the Service Layer

Basic Multi-Tier Distributed Systems Architecture:
- Mobile/Web user -> Internet -> Application Server -> Database

Application Server:
- Container (execution) environment for application services (APIs)
- Accepts client requests and invokes appropriate service functionality
- Multithreaded execution environment using a thread pool
- Connections to database managed through a connection pool

<b>Scaling Up</b>: Improve hardware to increase capacity
- There is a limit to how much a single server can scale up

<b>Scaling Out:</b>: Replicating a service an running multiple copies on multiple server nodes
- Cheap, commodity hardware
- Requests are distributed across the replicas
- Given N replicas, each node processes num_requests/N
- Mobile/Web user -> Internet -> Load Balancer -> Application Servers -> Session store/Database

State Management - Stateless
- User state information is stored externally in a Session Store rather than on particular service instances

<b>Scale Out Advantages</b>:
- Cheap
- Highly Available
	- Service instances manage no state so the system is resiliant to failures

## Scaling the Data Tier

Scaling out increases capacity but will eventually overload the database (i.e. database bottlencek)
- Slow queries -> longer response times
- Can lead to system component failure due to resource exhaustion

<b>Scaling Up for Database</b>: Increasing hardware capacity of a db instance

### Caching

<b>Caching the db</b>: Employing distributed caching in the service dier
- Caches store commonly accessed database results in memory
- Can be quickly retrieved without database access
- Distributed caches such as **Redis** or **memcached** widely used
- Essentially distributed Key-Value stores with very simple APIs

Caching works well for mostly read data

### Distributed Databases

Two main flavors:
1) **Distributed SQL stores**:
	- Store data across multiple disks that are queried by multiple database engine replicas
	- Multiple engines logically appear to the application as a single database, hence minimizing code changes
2) **Distributed "NoSQL" Stores**:
	- Variety of data models and query languages
	- Distribute data across multiple nodes running the database engine, each with their own locally attached storage
	- e.g. **Cassandra**, **MongoDB**, **Neo4j**

## Multiple Processing Tiers

Any scalable system has many services that interact to process a request

Stateless, cached, load-balanced services allow us to build a multi-tiered application

To fulfill a request, a service calls one or more downstream services

Multiple services can have their own caches but access the same service to access a database

<b>Advantages</b>
- Easier to build, test, modify
- Can be scaled individually based on the service demand

### Responsiveness

Request Latency = time interval between when client sent request and received the response

Responsiveness can be increased with queueing for later writes to database

Writes to a queue can be utilized when results of write are not immediately needed
- Queuing echnologies provide asynchronous communications based on the producer consumer pattern
- Data is eventually persisted
- Use cases should be resilient to longer delays
